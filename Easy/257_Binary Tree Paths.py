        thought:
        - The goal is to find and record every possible path from the root node to each leaf node in a binary tree.
        - In a binary tree, each node has up to two children: a left and a right node.
        - A path should stop once it reaches a leaf node (a node with no children).
        - Solution:
            - We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking to explore each possible path.
            - For each node, check both the left and right children, recursively traversing down each path until we reach a leaf node.
            - Backtracking allows us to explore all possible routes from the root to each leaf by "undoing" a choice and returning to explore other options.
        - Steps:
            (1) Start from the root node, initializing the path with the root node's value.
            (2) Recursively check both the left and right children.
If the current node is a leaf node (both children are None), record the path.
            (3) If the current node has a left child, add it to the path, recursively search down the left subtree, then backtrack.
            (4) Similarly, if there is a right child, add it to the path, recursively search down the right subtree, then backtrack.
            (5) Repeat this process until all paths from the root to each leaf are recorded.
