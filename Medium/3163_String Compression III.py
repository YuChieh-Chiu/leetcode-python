        thought:
        - Objective: Given a string `word`, use the following custom algorithm to compress it:
            (1) Create an empty string `comp`.
            (2) Iteratively remove the longest prefix from `word` and add the `{num}{char}` combination of the prefixâ€™s length and character to `comp`, repeating until `word` is empty.
                - Definition of prefix: A prefix is a substring consisting of a single repeated character, with a maximum length of 9.
        - Steps:
            (1) Create an empty string `comp`.
            (2) Define the function `extractMaxPrefix`, which performs the following tasks:
                - Check if the string `word` is empty; if so, return '' and `word`.
                - Create an empty string `prefix` to store the longest prefix to be removed from `word`.
                - While the length of `prefix` is less than 9, the next character matches the previous, and `word` is not empty, continue traversing `word`, removing characters one by one from the front. Stop when any condition is not met, and return `prefix` and the updated `word`.
            (3) Using the results from the previous step, if `prefix` is not empty, continue adding the `{num}{char}` combination of the prefix's length and character to `comp`; otherwise, exit the while loop and return the result.
